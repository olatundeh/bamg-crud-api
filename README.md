# Technical Exercise

The purpose of this document is to provide candidates with details of the technical exercise, which form part of the interview process at Bamg Sports Ltd.

Below are given details of the exercise and expectations.

Once the exercise has been submitted a code review interview will be conducted with the CTO to assess the candidate submission against expectations.

## Guidence

The Job Description highlights some of the major packages, languages and tools used by Bamg Sports during their day to day operations.  It is not expected that candidates use them all if they are not known to them already, however, it would be most helpful for the candidate to use as many of them as they are familiar with.

However, we strongly sugest the following tools be used: git, typescript, markdown for documentation

## Expectations

The purpose of the exercise is not a test, but to be a tool with which an informed dialog can be had with the candidate.  Example points which will be discussed in the review interview may include:

* Comprehension of the exercise and expectations
* Which tooling were chosen and why
* Discussions on planning and features that might be developed
* Use of versioning tools to aid development
* Any patterns that might be used
* Test of and or consideration for testing
* Self documentation

## Deliverables

Please provide a gitlab hosted repository containing all files associated files.

Include in that repository a DOCUMENTATION.md which should contain:
1. All notes your took for performing the exercise
1. Instructions for executing the submission
1. Any notes about additional work that could be achieved had you had more time
